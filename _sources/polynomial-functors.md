# Polyonomial Functors

$$F ::= Id \mid A \mid F \times F \mid F\plus F$$

We describe functors $L:\BA\to\BA$ or $L:\BA\times\BA\to\BA$
  by generators and relations as follows.
- $L_{K_C}(A)$ is the free $\BA$ given by generators $c\in C$
  and satisfying $c_1\wedge c_2=\bot$ for all $c_1\not=c_2$ and $\bigvee_{c\in
    C} c = \top$.
- $L_+(A_1,A_2)$ is generated by $[\kappa_1]a_1$,
  $[\kappa_2]a_2$, $a_i\in A_i$ where the $[\kappa_i]$ preserve finite
  joins and binary meets and satisfy $[\kappa_1] a_1\wedge
  [\kappa_2]a_2=\bot$, $[\kappa_1]\top\vee [\kappa_2]\top=\top$,
  $\neg[\kappa_1]a_1=[\kappa_2]\top\vee[\kappa_1]\neg a_1$,
  $\neg[\kappa_2]a_2=[\kappa_1]\top\vee[\kappa_2]\neg a_2$.
- $L_\times(A_1,A_2)$ is generated by $[\pi_1]a_1$,
  $[\pi_2]a_2$, $a_i\in A_i$ where $[\pi_i]$ preserve Boolean
  operations.
- $L_\Pow(A)$ is generated by $\Box a$, $a \in A$, and $\Box$
  preserves finite meets.
- $L_\hcal(A)$ is generated by $\Box a$, $a \in A$ (no equations).

For the semantics, we define Boolean algebra morphisms $\delta_T$
- $L_{K_C}\Pi X \to \Pi C$ \ by \ $c\mapsto \{c\}$, 
- $L_+(\Pi X_1,\Pi X_2) \to \Pi(X_1+X_2)$ \ by \ $[\kappa_i]a_i\mapsto a_i$, 
- $L_\times(\Pi X,\Pi Y) \to \Pi(X_1\times X_2)$ \ by \ $[\pi_1]a_1\mapsto a_1\times X_2$, $[\pi_2]a_2\mapsto X_1\times a_2$, 
- $L_\Pow \Pi X\to \Pi\Pow X$ \ by \ $\Box a \mapsto \{b\subseteq
  X\mid b\subseteq a\}$,
- $L_\hcal \Pi X\to \Pi\hcal X$ \ by \ $\Box a \mapsto \{s\in \hcal X
  \mid a \in s \}$.
  
and extend them inductively to $\delta_T:L_T\Pi\to\Pi T $ for all gKPF
$T$. To be precise, we will for the moment denote by
$(L'_T,\delta'_T)$ the $(L_T,\delta_T)$ given by the presentations in
this example and reserve the notation $(L_T,\delta_T)$ for the logics
given by Definition~\ref{def:LT}. We need to show that
$(L'_T,\delta'_T)$ is equivalent in the sense of
Theorem~\ref{thm:equiv-abs-concr-log} to $(L_T,\delta_T)$, in
other words, that the presentations of this example indeed present the
logics of Definition~\ref{def:LT}. This amounts to showing that
$(\delta'_T)_X: L'_T\Pi X\to \Pi TX$ is an isomorphism for all finite
sets $X$. It is exactly here where the machinery presented in this
paper needs to be supplemented by additional work depending on the
concrete presentation at hand. In our case this is essentially known:
(1)-(3) are slight variations of cases appearing in
Abramsky~\cite{abramsky:dtlf}, (4) is in
Abramsky~\cite{abramsky:cooks-tour}, and $\delta_X$ in (5) is given by
the identity on $2^{2^{2^X}}$.
