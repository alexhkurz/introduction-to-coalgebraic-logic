# Many-Valued Coalgebraic Logic

## References

There are at least two systematic ways to explore many-valued coalgebraic logic. 

One is to generalise coalgebras over orders to coalgebras over quantale-enriched categories. This line of work was begun in {cite}`bilkova-dostal:expressivity-many-valued`, which in turn was based on earlier work {cite}`bilkova-etal:relation-lifting:calco,bilkova-etal:relation-lifting:arxiv` on the order-enriched case. While this work studies coalgebras over preorders or over other quantale-enriched categories such as Lawvere metric spaces, {cite}`bilkova-dostal:many-valued:calco` develops a many-valued Moss's coalgebraic logic for coalgebras over sets. {cite}`bilkova-dostal:expressivity-many-valued` studies the expressivity of many-valued logics given by predicate liftings for coalgebras over sets.


The above mentioned {cite}`bilkova-dostal:many-valued:calco` introduce a notion of $\mathcal V$-lifting, which extends polynomial functors on sets to $\mathcal V$-enriched functors on $\mathcal V$-enriched categories for commutative and unital quantales $\mathcal V$. This construction has been generalised to arbitrary set-functors in {cite}`balan-etal:extending-functors:calco,balan-etal:extending-functors`, but these papers do not develop a coalgebraic logic parameterised by a quantale. From the point of view Stone duality, the missing step is a Stone duality parameterised by a quantale of truth values. While we know from general principles that such a duality exists, there is more work needed in presenting this duality in logical terms {cite}`babus-kurz:cmcs,balan-kurz:enriched-distributivity`.

From the point of view of quantale-enriched category theory, many-valued coalgebraic and coalgebraic logic over ordered sets are closely related. The latter have been studied in some detail by {cite}`bilkova-dostal:moss-logic-ordered`.

A second systematic way to explore many-valued coalgebraic logic is to replace the dual adunction between sets and Boolean algebras by an adjunction between sets and a category of algebras that is represented by a many-valued logic of interest.
