# coalgebraic-logic-jupyter

(under construction)

I currently maintain the version made with jupyter book version 2.

```
git checkout jupyter-book-2
source setup.sh
jupyter book start
```

This should make a local copy of the book available at [localhost](http://localhost:3000).

Current work is in the chapter "Outline of Quantale Enriched CL".

I will merge the branch jupyter-book-2 into main only after I had time to review all chapters.
