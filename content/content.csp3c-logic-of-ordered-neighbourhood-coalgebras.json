([up](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/ryrkkYZZc))\n\n## Introduction\n\nWe write $2$ for the 2-chain $0<1$ in various ordered categories such as posets or bounded distributed lattices.\n\nLet \n- $U:Pos\\to Pos$ take upsets ordered by reverse inclusion: $UX=[X,2]^o$\n- $D:Pos\\to Pos$ take downsets ordered by inclusion: $DX=[X^o,2]$\n\n\nLet \n\n- $\\mathcal X$ be the category of poset\n- $\\mathcal A$ be the category of bounded distributive lattices\n- $T=DU$\n\nThen $Coalg(T)$ is category of (monotone) neighbourhood frames (over posets). In particular $DUX=Up\\mathcal PX$ for discrete $X$. Note that $DUX=2^{2^X}$ if we define $2^X$ as the poset of monotone maps $X\\to 2$. \n\nLet \n- $P:\\mathcal X\\to\\mathcal A$ be the contravariant functor $X\\mapsto 2^X$.\n- $S:\\mathcal A\\to\\mathcal X$ the contravariant functor $A\\mapsto DL(A,2)$.\n\n\nThen \n- the dual $U^\\partial:DL\\to DL$ of $U$ is presented by operations and equations as follows. $U^\\partial A$ is generated by $\\{\\Box a\\mid a\\in PX\\}$ and the equations stating that $\\Box$ preserves finite meets.  This gives an isomorphism \n\n$$ U^\\partial PX\\to UPX$$ \n\n  for finite posets $X$.\n  \n- the dual $D^\\partial:DL\\to DL$ of $D$ is presented by operations and equations as follows. $D^\\partial A$ is generated by $\\{\\Diamond a\\mid a\\in PX\\}$ and the equations stating that $\\Diamond$ preserves finite meets.  This gives an isomorphism \n\n$$ D^\\partial PX\\to DPX$$ \n\nfor finite posets $X$.\n\n## The 2-sorted view\n\nWe can also think of coalgebras\n\n$$X \\to UDX$$\n\nas special 2-dimensional coalgebras\n\n$$(X,Y) \\to (UY,DX).$$\n\nThe dual of these coalgebras on the algebraic side are algebras\n\n\n$$(D^\\partial B,U^\\partial A)\\to (A,B)$$\n\n**Remark:** Given functors $F$ and $G$,  [Kurz-Petrisan](https://alexhkurz.github.io/papers/cmcs08-j.pdf) calls the functor which maps $(X,Y)$ to $(FY,GX)$ the symmetric composition of $F$ and $G$. While the presentation of the functor $FG$ is typically not compositional in the presentations of $F$ and $G$, the symmetric composition does have the obvious componentwise presentation.\n\n## An adjunction\n\nLet $Coalg(F,G)$ be the category of 2-sorted coalgebras of the kind\n\n$$(X,Y)\\to (FY,GX).$$\n\n**Theorem**: $Coalg(FG)$ is a full reflective subcategory of $Coalg(F,G)$.\n\n*Proof*: We map $X\\to FGX$ to $(X,GX)\\to (FGX,GX)$ where the second component is the identity. This functor has a left adjoint which maps  $(X,Y)\\to (FY,GX)$ to $X\\to FY\\to FGX$. \n\nThe unit of the adjunction is the obvious coalgebra morphism from $(X,Y)\\to (FY,GX)$ to $(X,GX)\\to (FGX,GX)$. The counit is the identity. \n\nMoreover, the right-adjoint is full and faithful. QED\n\n**Corollary**: $Coalg(FG)$ is closed under limits in $Coalg(F,G)$. In particular, the final coalgebra in $Coalg(F,G)$ is also the final coalgebra in $Coalg(FG)$.\n\n**Corollary:** $Alg(FG)$ is a full co-reflective subcategory of $Alg(F,G)$. \n\n**Corollary**: The category of $D^\\partial U^\\partial$-algebras is a full coreflective subcategory of $Alg(D^\\partial, U^\\partial)$.\n\n**Corollary**: $Alg(FG)$ is closed under colimits in $Alg(F,G)$. In particular, the initial algebra in $Alg(F,G)$ is also the initial algebra in $Alg(FG)$.\n\n## References\n\nPauly: ... \n\nHansen, Kupke: ...\n\nKurz, Petrisan: ...","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":88,"column":1}},"key":"Y00575slS9"}],"key":"yQxTEGvxQI"}],"key":"SShbsywBN8"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
