We only cover some highlights.\n\nIn all of the following $\\mathcal A$ is a variety in the sense of univeral algebra, that is, a category of algebras specified (finitary) operations equations. (We will assume all operations to be finitary in the following, even if we drop the qualifier.)\n\n## Sifted Colimits\n\n**Filtered categories** are precisely categories $\\mathcal D$ such that colimits over $\\mathcal D$ commute with finite limits in Set. There is also a characterization of filtered categories independent of sets – a category $\\mathcal D$ is filtered if and only if the diagonal functor $\\mathcal D \\to \\mathcal D^\\mathcal I$ is final for each finite category $\\mathcal I$. \n\n**Sifted categories** are the categories $\\mathcal D$ such that colimits over $\\mathcal D$ commute with finite products. These categories are characterized by the property that the diagonal functor $\\mathcal D \\to \\mathcal D \\times \\mathcal D$ is final.\n\n\n**Facts:** \n- Every filtered colimit is sifted.\n- Reflexive coequalisers are sifted but not filtered.\n- Sifted colimit preserving functors preserve filtered colimits. \n\nAn object $A$ of a category $\\mathcal C$ is **finitely presentable** if its hom-functor $hom(A, −) : \\mathcal C → Set$ preserves filtered colimits. A category $\\mathcal C$ is locally finitely presentable **(lfp)** if it is cocomplete and has a set $\\mathcal X$ of finitely presentable objects such that each object of $\\mathcal C$ is a filtered colimit of objects from $\\mathcal X$.\n\nAn object $A$ is **strongly finitely presentable** if its hom-functor $hom(A,−) : \\mathcal C → Set$ preserves sifted colimits. A category $\\mathcal C$ is strongly locally finitely presentable **(slfp)** if it is cocomplete and has a set $\\mathcal X$ of strongly finitely presentable objects such that each object of $\\mathcal C$ is a sifted colimit of objects from $\\mathcal X$.\n\nLet $\\mathcal A$ be a variety in the sense of universal algebra.\n\n**Facts:**\n- Finitely presentable objects in $\\mathcal A$ are algebras finitely presentable in a usual sense.\n- Strongly finitely presentable algebra = retract of finitely generated free algebra.\n- Finitely presentable algebra = reflexive coequalizer of strongly finitely presentable ones.\n- Sifted colimit preserving functors on $\\mathcal A$ are determined by their action on finitely generated free algebras.\n\nLet $Alg(L)$ be the categories of algebras for the functor $L:\\mathcal A\\to\\mathcal A$.\n\n**Theorem:** If $\\mathcal A$ is a variety and $L:\\mathcal A\\to \\mathcal A$ preserves sifted colimits then $Alg(L)$ is a variety.\n\n**Proposition:** \n- Let $\\mathcal A$ be a variety such that every finitely presentable algebra is projective. Then any functor $L : \\mathcal A \\to  \\mathcal A$ preserving filtered colimits preserves sifted colimits.\n- If $T:Set\\to Set$ preserves filtered colimits then $T$ preserves sifted colimits.\n- For any filtered colimit preserving functor $L : BA → BA$ there is a sifted colimit preserving functor $L′ : BA → BA$ such that $L$ and $L′$ are isomorphic when restricted to the full subcategory of BA without $1$. Moreover, $Alg(L) = Alg(L′)$.\n\n## Presenting Functors on Varieties\n\n### Introduction\n\nGiven an adjunction $L\\dashv R:\\mathcal C\\to \\mathcal X$ such that the right-adjoint $R$ is monadic (or of descent type) all objects $A\\in\\mathcal C$ have a presentation \"by generators and relations\"\n\n$$LRLRA\\rightrightarrows LRA \\to A.$$\n\nIn words, $A$ is the quotient of the free algebra $LRA$ over generators $RA$ by equations in $LRLRA$.\n\nWe apply this \"monadic presentation\" now to the situation where $A$ is an endofunctor. In fact, we apply it twice and combine two representations:\n\n*Step 1:* We represent a sifted colimit preserving endofunctor on a variety $\\mathcal A$ such that the \"generators\" and \"relations\" are given by sifted colimit preserving endofunctors on Set.\n\n*Step 2:* We represent a sifted colimit on Set as the quotient of polynomial functor.\n\n### Preliminaries\n\nLet $S(\\mathcal C)$ be the category of sifted colimit preserving functors $\\mathcal C\\to\\mathcal C$.\n\n**Fact:** The category $S(\\mathcal C)$ is slfp if $\\mathcal C$ is.\n\nA functor $H : \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ between slfp categories is called **algebraically exact** provided that it preserves limits and sifted colimits. \n\n**Fact:** If $H$ is algebraically exact it has a left adjoint. \n\n### Step 1\n\nLet $U:\\mathcal A\\to Set$ be a variety and $F\\dashv U$. Define\n\n$$\\Psi:S(\\mathcal A)\\to S(Set)$$\n\nvia $\\Psi L = ULF$ and \n\n$$\\Phi: S(Set) \\to S(\\mathcal A)$$\n\nvia $\\Phi T = FTU$. \n\n**Fact:** $\\Psi$ is algebraically exact and $\\Phi\\dashv\\Psi$.\n\nAfter the first step, we obtain a quotient $FULFU\\to L$. Here, $FULFU$ results from applying the free construction $\\Phi=F-U$ to the Set-functor $ULF$. What we need next is a presentation by operations and equations of $ULF$. \n\n### Step 2\n\nEvery sifted colimit preserving on $Set$ (=filtered colimit preserving functor=finitary functor) can be presented as the quotient of a polynomial functor. \n\nIndeed, if $T:Set\\to Set$ is finitary then we have a natural transformation\n\\begin{align}\n\\coprod_{n\\in\\mathbb N} Tn\\times X^n & \n\\stackrel {q_X} \\longrightarrow TX \\\\\n(\\sigma,v) & \\ \\mapsto \\ T(v)(\\sigma)\n\\end{align}\n\nwith each $q_X$ being surjective (even for infinite sets $X$).\n\nNote that $v$ can be seen both as a tuple $(x_1,\\ldots x_n)$ and as a function $n\\to X$. Hence we can evaluate the term $\\sigma(x_1,\\ldots x_n)$ by applying $Tv:Tn\\to TX$ to $\\sigma$.\n\nThis gives us a representation of $T$ as a functor by operations and equations where the set of $n$-ary operations is $Tn$ and the set of equations in $n$ variables is the kernel of $q_n$.\n\n### The Presentation\n\n**Theorem:** A functor on a variety has a presentation by operations and equations iff the functor preserves sifted colimits.\n\nTo prove \"if\", one shows that every sifted colimit preserving functor $L$ on a variety is a quotient\n\n$$FGUA\\stackrel {q_A} \\longrightarrow LA$$\n\nwhere $GX=\\coprod_{n\\in\\mathbb N}ULFn\\times X^n$. \n- The $n$-ary modal operators $\\sigma$ are the elements of $ULFn$.\n- $q_A$ maps $(\\sigma,v:n\\to UA)$ to $L(v^\\dagger)(\\sigma)$ where $v^\\dagger:Fn\\to A$ is the adjoint transpose of $v$.[^sigma]\n- The equations in $n$ variables are the kernel of $q_{Fn}$.\n\n[^sigma]: Note that $(\\sigma,v:n\\to UA)$ is a modal formula $\\Delta(a_1,\\ldots a_n)$ where $\\Delta=\\sigma$ and $a_i=v(i)$.\n\nIn particular the $(\\sigma,v:n\\to UA)$ are modal formulas \n\n$$\\Delta(a_1,\\ldots a_n)$$ \n\nwhere $\\Delta=\\sigma$ and $a_i=v(i)$.\n\nThe set $\\Sigma$ of operations and the set $E$ of equations constitute the presentation $\\langle\\Sigma_L,E_L\\rangle$ of $L$.\n\n**Theorem:** Let $\\mathcal A \\cong Alg(Σ_\\mathcal A, E_\\mathcal A)$ be a variety and $\\langle \\Sigma_L, E_L\\rangle$ a presentation of $L : \\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal A$. Then $Alg(Σ_\\mathcal A + \\Sigma_L, E_\\mathcal A+E_L)$ is isomorphic to Alg(L), where equations in $E_\\mathcal A$ and $E_L$ are understood as equations over $\\Sigma_\\mathcal A + \\Sigma_L$.\n\n**Example:** The variety of modal algebras is presented by the operations and equations of Boolean algebra plus a unary operation $\\Box$ and two equations specifying that $\\Box$ preserves finite meets.\n\n\n## References\n\nKurz-Rosicky: [Strongly Complete Logics for Coalgebras](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.2732.pdf), 2012.","position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1},"end":{"line":136,"column":1}},"key":"PeUZ7CX6OF"}],"key":"BTmSUmWfXf"}],"key":"X5orRJX3uQ"},"references":{"cite":{"order":[],"data":{}}}}
