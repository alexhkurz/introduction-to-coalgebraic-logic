# Coalgebraic Logic: A Survey

(draft ... far from complete)

At the moment the following is a loose collection of notes which I started to write for myself. But writing improves with an audience in mind. And markdown makes publishing easy. So while I consider these still private notes, I am happy to share them and to make any extensions and improvements. So if you happen to pass by, don't hesitate to get in touch.

Notes from a talk on [The Landscape of Coalgebraic Logic](https://hackmd.io/@alexhkurz/Skc7tOx6F) surveying some of the reserach on coalgebraic logic since it beginnings in the 1990ies.

( ... I also have a page with various [lecture notes](https://alexhkurz.github.io/teaching-phd-courses.html) and most of my [publications](https://alexhkurz.github.io/publications.html) ... )
